## Design Process

As a passionate Stray Kids fan myself, I understand the excitement and dedication that comes with being part of the K-pop community. While designing SKZ SHOP, my primary focus was on creating an immersive and user-friendly platform tailored specifically for fans of Stray Kids and K-pop enthusiasts. The goal was to provide a one-stop destination where users could easily explore, discover, and purchase authentic merchandise that resonates with the spirit of Stray Kids.
User Stories:

    • As a Stray Kids fan (Stay), I want to easily navigate through the website, so that I can quickly find the latest and exclusive merchandise featuring my favorite group.
    
    • As a K-pop fashion enthusiast, I want to explore trendy and stylish apparel inspired by Stray Kids' iconic looks, so that I can incorporate their style into my own wardrobe.

    • As a user looking for gifts for a Stray Kids fan, I want a variety of options and easy filtering, so that I can find the perfect, unique gift for my friend or family member.

    • As a first-time K-pop listener curious about Stray Kids, I want a user-friendly interface that provides information about the group, their music, and a beginner's guide to K-pop, so that I can get started on my K-pop journey.

    • As a user concerned about the authenticity of merchandise, I want clear product descriptions, reviews, and assurance of genuine products, so that I can confidently make purchases.

SKZ SHOP is designed to cater to these user stories by offering a visually appealing, organized website with intuitive navigation, a diverse range of merchandise, and informative content about Stray Kids and K-pop. By focusing on user needs and interests, SKZ SHOP aims to be the go-to platform for fans looking to express their love for Stray Kids and K-pop through authentic and stylish merchandise.

Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
